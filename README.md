Project to controle a mechanical arm with an EEG device

The code was used with a device from the brand ENOBIO and retrieves data through 
the stream created by NIC, the software given with EEG. This was made thanks to pylsl
(python la streaming layer)
	The user interface allows user to record their cognitive activity while performing
different tasks (defined in experience and protocole files) and to visualize predictions made 
by a classifier trained on the previously recorded datas.
	The user interface ultimately allows the user to control a mechanical arm using arduino. 
	The user interface was made with tkinter, and includes french and english words
depending on the devoloper's state of mind while he was coding ;)
